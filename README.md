# BeatSaber-Trainer
A mod to help you practice

A simple mod that takes the way the Practice Plugin modifies the note jump speed and applies it to every song you play.
The settings can be found in the left Player Settings pane when a song is selected. You can also use hotkeys Ctrl+J and Ctrl+K to decrease/increase the jump speed while playing as long as you have it enabled in Player Settings (for voice commands).

You will not submit scores to ScoreSaber when this mod is enabled.

Required dependencies are BeatSaberCustomUI and BS_Utils.

Build Instructions:

In the project folder there is a batch file called CreateJunctions.bat. Either drag your Beat Saber game folder onto the batch file or enter the full path to your Beat Saber folder into the prompt after double-clicking the batch file.
